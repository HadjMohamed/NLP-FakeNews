The reason for the attacks in six villages in Plateau s Bokkos district last week was not immediately known but it is the worst outbreak of violence since December 2023, when more than 100 people were killed in the same district. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said the scale of the violence became clearer at the weekend as 52 people were confirmed dead while 22 others were taken to hospital. NEMA said in a statement late on Sunday that  gunmen carried out brutal assaults,” leading to multiple fatalities and widespread destruction of property.  Over 1,820 individuals have been displaced. Three displacement camps have been established,” the agency said, adding that the security situation remained tense. President Bola Tinubu directed security agencies to hunt down the attackers, who would face  severe punishment”, the presidency said. Plateau is one of several ethnically and religiously diverse hinterland states known as Nigeria s Middle Belt, where inter-communal conflict has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years. The violence is often painted as ethno-religious conflict between Muslim herders and mainly Christian farmers. But climate change and the reduction of grazing land through agricultural expansion are also major factors.",true,Trustful news,0.50503367185592651

The European Union has been very, very bad to us, they don t take our cars, like Japan in that sense, they don t take our agricultural product. They don t take anything practically,  Trump told reporters at the White House.Last week, Trump announced a 20 per cent tariff on European goods. This new tariff policy is expected to begin on April 9.Trump also said that the EU was created to gain an advantage over the United States. The EU has been very tough over the years. It was formed to do damage to the United States in trade. It was formed with all of the countries from Europe. I guess most of them, not all of them, but most of them formed together to create a little bit of a monopoly situation to create a unified force against the United States trade. They re sending millions and millions of cars into the US, but we don t have a car that s been sold to the European Union or other places,  Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House.Trump s comments came after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen made a proposal on Monday. She suggested a mutual agreement to remove tariffs on cars and other industrial products. We have proposed zero tariffs on industrial products... Europe is always ready to strike a good deal  with the United States, von der Leyen said during a press conference in Brussels. But  we are also ready to respond with countermeasures and defend our interests  against Trump s trade offensive, she warned.Trump also said on Monday that the trade imbalance would reduce quickly if European countries started buying American energy. They need to buy and commit to purchasing an amount equivalent (to this trade deficit) in energy,  Trump said.",true,Trustful news,0.513717770576477

In a stinging attack on aid cuts and the  nationalistic winds” blowing across Europe and the US, the Norwegian Refugee Council s head told the Guardian how people were living out in the open, in overcrowded, unsanitary displacement encampments around the city of Goma, where 1.2 million people have had to flee from their homes as the M23 rebels advanced through the DRC s North and South Kivu provinces.  The level of global neglect experienced by civilians in eastern DRC should shame world leaders,” he said, adding that European countries and others had ignored the suffering for years.

Photograph: Ed Prior/NRC  We hope that a Europe and the US, which is very self-centred, where nationalistic winds are blowing, where aid is being cut and international solidarity is not what it was, will open their eyes to the immense suffering that is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” said Egeland, who has just returned from a visit to the area.  [I saw] overflowing latrines, 25 people sleeping in a classroom where they have to drag their few belongings out every morning because the classroom is used for school, then every afternoon return to the classroom to sleep overnight. It s really subhuman,” he said. Eastern DRC has long suffered from violence, and the camps in Goma, capital of North Kivu province, host people who have been displaced for years.

Photograph: Ed Prior/NRC However, conditions have deteriorated since the M23 rebellion launched in 2022. The Rwandan-backed group has managed to seize large parts of eastern DRC, including Goma and other key towns, since January. Egeland said the humanitarian situation had been complicated by M23 forcing displaced people to leave the camps, often giving them only 72 hours to move on. Many people had returned to their homes, where there was relative safety now that the M23 had taken control. He warned, however, that a political settlement was needed now as well as aid, especially in the form of cash, to ensure displaced people could buy food and rebuild their homes and livelihoods in places devastated by years of conflict. Egeland said charities were struggling because they often had still not been paid for work done last year because of President Donald Trump s freezing of US aid spending in January, and even projects that had been approved by Washington had not yet received money. He said that while support from Norway, which had fast-tracked pre-existing pledges, had allowed the NRC to continue working, other humanitarian organisations were struggling.  At a time of enormous needs – because of the recent increase in fighting – and of opportunity [to help] the many who can return, the money is not coming in,” he said.  It means people are not helped, they linger in camps with worsening conditions, that children cannot go to school.”",true,Trustful news,0.51626801490783691

They announced in mid-March that the chances had gone up for Mount Spurr to blow  within the next few weeks or months.  So how do they know that? And what should Southcentral Alaska residents do in the meantime? Here s what to know. (And if we missed your question, let us know in the form below.) Why do scientists think Mount Spurr will erupt? It s showing all the signs: There have been recent earthquakes nearby, the volcano s surface has expanded, there s melting snow on its peak and there s higher-than-normal emissions of volcanic gases.  It s almost like we have a checklist of the usual signs that volcanoes give us before they progress to an eruption,” said Matt Haney, the scientist in charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.  And now we re seeing all four of those are giving us those indicators.” Wesley Early / Alaska Public Media Researcher Matt Haney shows eruption models for Mount Spurr at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage. Where exactly is Mount Spurr and what s close to it? Mount Spurr is the tallest volcano in the Aleutian Arc, a batch of several dozen volcanic islands stretching from Southcentral Alaska along the Aleutian Chain to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East. Spurr is about 80 miles west of Anchorage, but it s in a very remote area. You have to charter a plane to get there and Haney said there s little infrastructure there beyond the Alaska Volcano Observatory s monitoring stations. The closest community is the village of Tyonek, on the west side of Cook Inlet, and it s roughly 40 miles away by plane. Alaska Volcano Observatory/Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys A location map of Spurr Volcano, in Alaska s Cook Inlet region. So, at this point, how certain are scientists that an eruption will happen anytime soon? In February, scientists said there were equal chances the volcano would erupt or not. Then, on March 12, they said it s more likely to erupt than not . But there s no specific percent chance to apply to it. So, for example, scientists can t say there s a 75% likelihood of eruption.  We haven t quantified what that is in terms of a percentage,” Haney said.  But it is judged to be higher likelihood than this unrest dissipating.” Will we get notice before it erupts? Kind of. It s unlikely scientists will be able to say,  Hey Alaskans, Mount Spurr will erupt in two hours!” Instead, we ll see changes in the volcano s alert level. As of March 19, Mount Spurr s color code was yellow, or in  advisory” status, which means there s increased unrest. There are two levels above that: The  watch” or orange level means an eruption is even more imminent, or it could be underway but still posing only limited hazards to people. (That s the case currently at Great Sitkin, far out in the Aleutian Islands, which is erupting and on  watch” status). The  warning” or red level means a hazardous eruption is  imminent, underway, or suspected.” Scientists are watching Spurr for an increase in the four eruption indicators mentioned earlier that would trigger elevating its alert level.  If we were to see volcanic tremor, if we were to see increased earthquake activity, increased gas emissions, increased melting of the snow and ice at the volcano, then those would be indications that we would go to the next level in our color code system, which is orange watch,” Haney said.  And then finally, if it were to go to an eruption, we would go to red warning.” So, Mount Spurr could erupt in weeks or months. Is there any more specific timeline? No, not right now. Even if the volcano hits an orange alert, Haney said, that doesn t necessarily mean an eruption is imminent. In fact, he said Mount Redoubt returned to yellow status after an orange alert in late January 2009.  It stayed at orange for several weeks, and then in early March 2009 it was reduced to yellow because the tremor declines,” Haney said.  Then it went back to orange because there was a small steam-driven eruption, not a magmatic eruption, at the summit of Redoubt. Then again, the activity declined. It went to yellow.” It finally ended up erupting between 10:30 and 11 p.m. on March 29, 2009. Redoubt s eruption lasted several months and, at times, shot ash up to 65,000 feet. So if Mount Spurr erupts, where will we hear about it? In the event of a change in advisory – from yellow to orange or from orange to red – the Alaska Volcano Observatory will send out an alert on its website and notify its various community partners, like city and state emergency officials. You can sign up for alerts from the observatory here . Residents can also sign up for emergency updates from Anchorage by texting ANCHORAGE to 67283 or signing up online. If you re closer to it, can you actually hear it erupting? That depends on a number of factors, including how close you are to the volcano, the size of the eruption and which way the wind is blowing, Haney said. However, most eruption sounds are at a frequency too low for human ears to pick up, he said.  A Spurr eruption similar to those in 1953 and 1992 would likely not be audible for people in Anchorage but would be audible if one were close to the volcano. However it wouldn t be advisable to be that close,” Haney said.  Ash-producing eruptions can produce volcanic lightning in the ash cloud due to friction between volcanic ash particles, and that lightning produces thunder, which may be audible at further distances.” What would an eruption look like and how long would it last? Do we know?  More often than not, we have explosive eruptions that fragment magma and shoot ash, you know, 50,000 feet into the atmosphere,” Haney said. The ash clouds produced by the eruption could move to Anchorage, if the wind happens to be blowing out of the west. In 1992, Spurr s eruption resulted in three explosions, occuring in June, August and September. The 1953 eruption saw one explosion. R.G. McGimsey / Alaska Volcano Observatory A roiling eruption column rising from Mount Spurr s Crater Peak vent during its Aug. 18, 1992 eruption. (Source adjusted color and removed date label via Photoshop.) The eruptions can last from a few minutes to several hours, Haney said.  For example, the eruptions in 1992, the ones in June, August and September each lasted approximately four hours,” Haney said. What happened the last time Spurr erupted in 1992? Spurr exploded three times. The winds during the first and third eruptions blew the ashfall to the north and south of Spurr, respectively.  But on August 18, 1992, which was the second of the three explosions, the winds were blowing to Anchorage that day, and the ash was carried over Anchorage, and ashfall ensued on Anchorage,” Haney said. In total, the city got hit with about an eighth of an inch of ash. In response, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport was shut down for about 20 hours. We have more about impacts to air travel below, but first… Who and what in Southcentral Alaska would be impacted if Spurr erupts? Ashfall will be the main concern for Southcentral, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesman for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. When and where that might fall, though, depends on the circumstances.  The impacts of a Mount Spurr eruption are unknown,” Zidek said.  There s a lot of key factors that will really come down to when it erupts, how long it erupts, what the wind direction is and other factors that could change, where that ash falls and how thick the ash falls.” Zidek urged Alaskans to keep monitoring information from the volcano observatory . The division has also posted a list of frequently asked questions about a potential eruption on its website. While there are communities closer to Spurr than Anchorage, like Tyonek and Beluga on the west side of Cook Inlet, Haney said they re still far enough from the volcano that they shouldn t be impacted by things like mudslides or pyroclastic flows. Emergency officials from the Municipality of Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula Borough have held coordinated meetings since October in preparation for a potential eruption. What are emergency agencies doing now? Zidek said the division has been speaking with stakeholders across the region, including the volcano observatory, the National Weather Service, local emergency managers and utility companies.  We ve been kind of coordinating, coming together, developing information for people in the pre-eruption phase, so they have a good expectation of what a Mount Spurr eruption will look like,” he said. Is there anything I should do now to prepare? For now, Zidek said, the state is mainly asking that people remain informed.  Understand that we may see an eighth of an inch to a quarter-inch of ash, or somewhere in that realm, in some places of Southcentral,” he said.  It all depends on the eruption and the wind speed, so there s a lot of things that where that ash is going to fall, that it s contingent on.” You may want to have masks on hand now, Zidek said. If the volcano erupts, what should I do to protect myself and my family? R.G. McGimsey / Alaska Volcano Observatory Ashfall deposit on a car in Anchorage after Mount Spurr s August 1992 eruption. Ashfall can cause respiratory problems. The most important step to protect yourself from ashfall is wearing a mask when going outdoors, Zidek said.  N95 masks are kind of the preferred mask that people would want to use, but really, any type of face covering that prevents ash from entering your lungs is better than no covering at all,” he said.  So if it s a surgical mask or an old COVID cloth mask, if it s some type of makeshift mask, that s better than nothing at all.” Zidek also recommended avoiding tracking ashfall back inside. Pets should have only limited excursions outdoors during ashfall, and any ash that falls on them should be cleaned from their coats. Beyond aviation concerns, Zidek said, ashfall is primarily an air quality issue, similar to spring allergens or dust from the sanding of roads. Some longtime Alaskans have already experienced ashfall events during previous eruptions of Spurr and Mount Redoubt, he said.  While the ash is a hazard, it s not something that we haven t dealt with before, from volcanoes and from other air quality events,” Zidek said.  We just need to be aware of it and take some basic steps to protect ourselves.” How does volcanic ash affect people with respiratory issues? Will they have to stay indoors? Anchorage Chief Medical Officer Dr. George Conway said people should reduce the time they spend outdoors in the event of an eruption, especially if they have respiratory issues. Minerals from the volcano known as silicates get suspended in air by an eruption, and they re sharp and can cause inflammation of the lungs, Conway said.  People that already have respiratory illnesses might be exacerbated, but they re both quite harmful if they re inhaled repeatedly or deeply, and they can contribute to both acute illness and chronic diseases,” Conway said. Conway said there s also a potential dual harm if Spurr s eruption coincides with wildfires, as smoke from the latter could make air quality even worse. Like with other natural disasters, Conway suggested people keep a cache of food, water and any necessary medication at their homes and shelter in place as much as possible. If they do have to leave their home, Conway, like Zidek, recommended people wear an N95 mask, as well as some kind of protective eyewear. How can I protect my property? Cars are at particular risk from volcanic ash, which is abrasive and can damage windshields if it s brushed away, Zidek said. Instead, try to pour washer fluid over the ash from the windshield, instead of using wipers. Ash is also bad for car engines, and people should try to minimize driving during or after ashfall. If possible, cars should be stored in a garage or covered when not in use.  We recommend that if people do need to drive in ashy areas that they change their air filters or clean their air filters regularly and change their oil more often,” he said. Why is volcanic ash bad for air travel, anyway? Ash is known to shut down jet engines and cause severe damage to plane exteriors. In December 1989, a 747 flew through ash from another nearby volcano, Mount Redoubt, and the plane s engines shut down, forcing an emergency landing in Anchorage with 231 passengers aboard. How might this affect Alaska commuter air traffic? Both cargo and passenger flights would be impacted by an eruption, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport spokesperson Lex Yelverton said.  (The) severity would depend on magnitude of the event and wind,” Yelverton said.  All airlines have their own internal operating practices, so for more details I would encourage them to ask airlines directly.” Isn t the Anchorage airport one of the busiest in the world? How is it preparing? Officials with the Anchorage airport said they are working in collaboration with the Fairbanks International Airport to prepare for an eruption. That includes ensuring the airport has extra filters on hand, figuring out plans for ash removal and  reaching out to our partners both on- and off-airport to determine transportation and lodging accommodations, if needed, for any potentially stranded passengers,” Yelverton said. On the ground in Anchorage, how would the city clean up ash? Though the timeline is still uncertain, Anchorage Disaster Recovery Coordinator Kari Wiederkehr said if ashfall hits the city, it would likely coincide with street sweeping season.  And when you do clean it up, if I remember correctly, it s better if it s wet so it doesn t kick up a lot of dust,” she said. Wesley Early / Alaska Public Media Anchorage Disaster Recovery Coordinator Kari Wiederkehr holds up the city s comprehensive emergency operations plan, which includes contingencies for volcanic eruptions. A lot of the city s response will be based on how much ash is blown into Anchorage, if at all, Wiederkehr said. Is it safe to watch the eruption? There should be ways for residents to see the eruption from a safe distance on a clear day at Anchorage s Point Woronzof, Haney said.  When it comes into Anchorage, it will be almost like a sandstorm with dark ash,” he said.  It will, if it occurs in daylight, it ll block out the sun.” If it comes at night, Haney said, onlookers can be in for a different visual spectacle  It can produce a large amount of lightning,” he said.  We call it volcanic lightning. It s due to charges getting set up by the ash particles scraping up next to each other.” So what are scientists doing now? They re keeping a close eye on the volcano.  We have a local seismic network of 11 stations that bring data back in real time, and we are watching it like a hawk,” Haney said.  We have automated alarms on the data, and we re looking for particular signs that will be the next step in the progression towards an eruption, should it go that way.” If the volcano reaches that  watch” level, there will be a minimum of two scientists monitoring Spurr around-the-clock.

1jth6zf,2025-04-07 09:30:04,Israel controls 50% of Gaza after razing land to expand its buffer zone,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-buffer-zone-ceasefire-b7dada19483a3f8ef2fdecbc745ee6b5,noobcoder2,Reddit,Israel controls 50% of Gaza after razing land to expand its buffer zone,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel has dramatically expanded its footprint in the Gaza Strip since relaunching its war against Hamas last month. It now controls more than 50% of the territory and is squeezing Palestinians into shrinking wedges of land. The largest contiguous area the army controls is around the Gaza border, where the military has razed Palestinian homes, farmland and infrastructure to the point of uninhabitability, according to Israeli soldiers and rights groups. This military buffer zone has doubled in size in recent weeks. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC show the town of Khuzaa, east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip (Planet Labs PBC via AP) Israel has depicted its tightening grip as a temporary necessity to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that started the war. But the land Israel holds, which includes a corridor that divides the territory s north from south, could be used for wielding long-term control, human rights groups and Gaza experts say. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that even after Hamas is defeated, Israel will keep security control in Gaza and push Palestinians to leave. The demolition close to the Israeli border and the systematic expansion of the buffer zone has been going on since the war began 18 months ago, five Israeli soldiers told The Associated Press.  They destroyed everything they could, they shot everything that looks functioning ... (the Palestinians) will have nothing to come back, they will not come back, never,” a soldier deployed with a tank squad guarding the demolition teams said. He and four other soldiers spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. A report documenting the accounts of soldiers who were in the buffer zone was released Monday by Breaking The Silence, an anti-occupation veterans group. A handful of soldiers -- including some who also spoke to AP -- described watching the army turn the zone into a vast wasteland.  Through widespread, deliberate destruction, the military laid the groundwork for future Israeli control of the area,” said the group. Asked about the soldiers  accounts, the Israeli army said it is acting to protect its country and especially to improve security in southern communities devastated by the Oct. 7 attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. The army said it does not seek to harm civilians in Gaza, and that it abides by international law. Carving Gaza into sections In the early days of the war, Israeli troops forced Palestinians from communities near the border and destroyed the land to create a buffer zone more than a kilometer (0.62 miles) deep, according to Breaking The Silence. Its troops also seized a swath of land across Gaza known as the Netzarim Corridor that isolated the north, including Gaza City, from the rest of the narrow, coastal strip, home to more than 2 million people. When Israel resumed the war last month, it doubled the size of the buffer zone, pushing it as far as 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) into Gaza in some places, according to a map issued by the military. The buffer zone and the Netzarim Corridor make up at least 50% of the strip, said Yaakov Garb, a professor of environmental studies at Ben Gurion University, who has been examining Israeli-Palestinian land use patterns for decades. Last week, Netanyahu said Israel intends to create another corridor that slices across southern Gaza, cutting off the city of Rafah from the rest of the territory. Israel s control of Gaza is even greater taking into account areas where it recently ordered civilians to evacuate ahead of planned attacks. Neighborhoods turned into rubble Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians used to live in the land that now makes up Israel s buffer zone, an area that was key to Gaza s agricultural output. Satellite images show once-dense neighborhoods turned to rubble, as well as nearly a dozen new Israeli army outposts since the ceasefire ended. When the ceasefire was announced in January, Nidal Alzaanin went back to his home in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. His property stood on the edge of the buffer zone and lay in ruins.

His greenhouse was reduced to twisted scraps of metal. The 55-year-old farmer pitched a tent in the rubble, hoping to rebuild his life. But when Israel resumed its campaign and seized his land, he was again uprooted.  It took 20 years to build a house and within five minutes they destroyed all my dreams and my children s dreams,” he said from Gaza City, where he now shelters. Israel s bombardment and ground offensives throughout the war have left vast swaths of Gaza s cities and towns destroyed. But the razing of property inside the buffer zone has been more methodical and extensive, soldiers said. The five soldiers who spoke to the AP said Israeli troops were ordered to destroy farmland, irrigation pipes, crops and trees as well as thousands of buildings, including residential and public structures, so that militants had nowhere to hide. Several soldiers said their units demolished more buildings than they could count, including large industrial complexes. A soda factory was leveled, leaving shards of glass and solar panels strewn on the ground.

The soldier with the tank squad said an armored bulldozer flattened land creating a  kill zone” and that anyone who came within 500 meters of the tanks would be shot, including women and children. Visibly shaken, he said many of the soldiers acted out of vengeance for the Oct. 7 attack.  I came there because they kill us and now we re going to kill them. And I found out that we re not only killing them. We re killing them, we re killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs, and we destroyed their houses,” he said. The army said its attacks are based on intelligence and that it avoids  as much as possible, harm to non-combatants.” Long-term hold?

In announcing the new corridor across southern Gaza, Netanyahu said Israel aims to pressure Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, of whom 35 are believed dead. He also said the war can only end when Hamas is destroyed and its leaders leave Gaza, at which point Israel would take control of security in the territory. Then, Netanyahu said, Israel would implement U.S. President Donald Trump s call to move Palestinians from Gaza, what Israel calls  voluntary emigration.” Some Israel analysts say the purpose of the buffer zone isn t to occupy Gaza, but to secure it until Hamas is dismantled.  This is something that any sane country will do with regard to its borders when the state borders a hostile entity,” said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at two Israeli think tanks, the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute. But rights groups say forcibly displacing people is a potential war crime and a crime against humanity. Within Gaza s buffer zones, specifically, it amounts to  ethnic cleansing,” because it was clear people would never be allowed to return, said Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. Israel called the accusations baseless and said it evacuates civilians from combat areas to protect them. ___ Associated Press reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",true,Trustful news,0.51710331439971924

In a surprising geopolitical shift, the Taliban has reportedly handed over control of Bagram Air Base to the United States. According to journalist Zark Shabab s report on Medium, U.S. C-17 aircraft recently landed at the base, bringing military vehicles, equipment, and senior intelligence officials. Among the reported arrivals is the Deputy Chief of the CIA, highlighting the strategic significance of this renewed American presence at Bagram. While not yet officially confirmed, these developments suggest active intelligence interests in Afghanistan. Bagram Air Base holds historical importance as the largest U.S. military hub during America s 20-year war in Afghanistan. After the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in August 2021, the Taliban took control of the base, marking a significant power shift in the region. Interestingly, the Taliban had initially refused to return the airbase to U.S. forces, viewing it as a symbol of sovereignty. This reported handover now raises questions about secret diplomacy or a tactical recalibration between the Taliban and U.S. agencies. Analysts are divided on what this means. some see it as a strategic realignment aimed at counterterrorism collaboration against threats like ISIS-K, while others suspect the Taliban may be leveraging the move to gain political legitimacy or economic concessions. The reappearance of senior CIA officials at Bagram implies a potential rebuilding of U.S. intelligence networks in the region. However, no official statement has been issued by Washington or Kabul confirming the nature of this operation. This sudden development is expected to draw reactions from regional stakeholders such as Iran, China, Russia, and Pakistan — all of whom are closely monitoring U.S. involvement in Central and South Asia. If confirmed, the return of the U.S. to Bagram, with Taliban cooperation, could signal the beginning of a new chapter in U.S.-Taliban relations — one defined by pragmatism, intelligence coordination, and evolving regional dynamics.",true,Trustful news,0.51730048656463623

Sri Lanka, govt sources said, used the ambulances gifted by India to launch its national emergency ambulance service and, as time passed by, added more ambulances to the fleet. Today, the fleet size of ambulances has grown to 322. It is used to provide free emergency transportation services to the whole country day and night,  Sri Lankan minister of health and media Nalinda Jayatissa told PM Modi in a communication shared on Saturday.According to Jayatissa, 2.24 million emergencies have been handled by the ambulance service since 2016. This includes road accidents and cardiac or stroke cases. Out of the above, 65% of the emergencies fall into the  critical golden hour  category which means the patient would have lost his or her life if not for this ambulance service. That is nearly 1.5 million lives saved up to now due to your generosity and continues to save lives in Sri Lanka,  Jayatissa said.Officials said the success story of Sri Lanka s ambulance services is also a shining example of cooperation between the two neighbouring nations. Recently, when a massive earthquake jolted Myanmar, India launched  Operation Brahma  to provide necessary support, including search and rescue, humanitarian aid, disaster relief and medical assistance. Under this initiative, the govt sent 15 tonnes of relief material, including tents, blankets, sleeping bags, food packets, hygiene kits, generators, and essential medicines within 24 hours of the disaster. More support, including 442 metric tonnes of food aid, was delivered last week.",true,Trustful news,0.517403781414032

Musk — not someone known for biting his tongue — has kept quiet on the protests, with his X account making little mention of the Turkish turmoil. By contrast, the tech entrepreneur has meddled in European politics in the past year. He criticized United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer for his handling of protests last summer and comparing the U.K. to the Soviet Union. He called the European Union s former digital affairs chief, Thierry Breton, a  tyrant of Europe.  And recently he lashed out against a French court verdict finding far-right leader Marine Le Pen guilty of embezzlement and blocking her from a 2027 presidential run. X said after the protests began that it had been ordered by the Turkish government to suspend some 700 accounts. Dündar s account was suspended along with 177 others last October within a broad shutdown of online accounts. X said last week it had challenged a shutdown order in the country s Constitutional Court. However, the order in question, seen by POLITICO, predates the protest by weeks. X did not respond to a question from POLITICO as to whether it has appealed any more recent government orders.

The report notes that during the first attack — in late January on Kenscoff, in the southern end of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince — it took Haiti s military, police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police roughly five hours to respond. The report said authorities had received information about the attack and that the delay possibly underscored a  lack of alignment” between Haiti s National Police and the government.  The sequence of events in Kenscoff appears to indicate that the security forces did not initially take adequate measures to prevent the first attacks, nor to ensure the rapid deployment of specialized police units, despite reports of an imminent threat posed by gangs,” the U.N. mission said. Staggering numbers At least 31 people were killed, 27 others were injured and some 70 homes were burned before security forces arrived and repelled the gangs, killing at least 23 gunmen, the mission said. Later the same day in the neighborhood of Carrefour, in the western region of the metro area, at least 30 civilians were killed in another wave of gang attacks. Overall, from Jan. 27 to March 27, at least 262 people were reported killed and another 66 were injured in Kenscoff and parts of Carrefour, according to the report.  This revealed once again the fractures and tension that exist between the prime minister and the police chief and the lack of coordination in the state s response to the gang threat,” said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. The attacks also revealed the inability of police to react to all the threats they receive and process them to confirm whether they re rumors or credible information that can be used to prevent an attack, he said. A spokesman for Haiti s National Police did not return a message seeking comment. Among those killed from January to March were 147 suspected gang members and a one-month-old baby that gunmen threw into a fire during one attack, the U.N. mission, known as BINUH, said. More than 3,000 people in those communities were left homeless, with gangs setting fire to more than 190 homes and raping at least seven women and girls, including a 41-year-old mother who was breastfeeding her baby and was gang raped, the report said. ‘Extreme brutality  The gangs prepared for the attack by hiding weapons and ammunition in drums normally used to carry water and fuel and placing them on the backs of donkeys that walked through nearby hills undetected, the report said.  Gang members displayed extreme brutality, seeking to sow fear among the population,” it also said.  They executed men, women, and children inside their homes and shot others on the roads and trails as they tried to flee the violence.” Overall, from Jan. 1 to March 27, more than 1,500 people have been reported killed across Haiti, and 572 others injured, BINUH said. Two journalists also have been reported missing in recent days. The home of Jean Christophe Collègue, former correspondent for Voice of America, was set on fire, and he hasn t been seen since, according to a statement by the Association of Haitian Journalists. Meanwhile, a video posted on social media shows Radio Ginen reporter Israël Roger Claudy and his brother being abducted by gangs, the association said.  Every journalist killed or missing, every media company vandalized or set on fire is an attack against democracy,” it added. A fallen city Gangs are estimated to control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, but many believe the city already has fallen, said Jake Johnston, international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research.  For the vast majority, that threshold was passed long ago,” he said. On April 2, thousands of protesters marched toward the offices of the prime minister and the transitional presidential council demanding an end to gang violence as they confronted police and were met with gunfire and tear gas.  What it really shows you is the sort of level of frustration,” Johnson said.  Taking to the streets to protest in this context is obviously not a safe thing to do, but people are willing to risk their lives.” The United Nations has warned that the mission led by Kenyan police is lacking funds and personnel, operating with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.  What s clear is that sitting around and waiting for more external help in doing this is not a viable strategy,” Johnston said.",true,Trustful news,0.51746225357055664

One of the ways that that can disappear easily and quickly is they re gonna have to buy our energy from us ... they can buy it, we can knock off $350 billion in one week. They have to buy and commit to buy a like amount of energy.  Von der Leyen s offer came after Trump last week slapped 20 percent tariffs on the EU and a minimum 10 percent levy on other trade partners. In response, financial markets across the world have lost trillions of dollars in value, with European stocks on Monday suffering their biggest one-day falls since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A lot of people say,  Oh, it doesn t mean anything having a surplus.  It means a lot, in my opinion. It s almost like a profit or loss statement,  Trump said. The president was speaking in the Oval Office Monday alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who traveled to Washington to hold talks with Trump and seek relief from the U.S. tariffs. In comments to the press after the meeting, the American president doubled down on his criticism of the EU but indicated he was up for doing a deal with the bloc, as long as it committed to closing its trade deficit with the U.S. by buying more American energy. The idea of buying U.S. energy in a bid to stave off tariffs is not a new one. Almost as soon as Trump was reelected, von der Leyen suggested opening negotiations to buy more American liquefied natural gas (LNG). But POLITICO reported that the U.S. had, in response, offered no clarity about how a deal would work. On Monday, asked whether his global tariffs were a strong-arm negotiation tactic or permanent, Trump said:  There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations, because there are things we need beyond tariffs.

The 25% tariff—announced as part of a broader crackdown on Chinese imports—could particularly affect Polestar, which currently imports the Polestar 2 model from China. The firm described the Geely-backed automaker as  significantly impacted,” adding that Polestar has already removed new Polestar 2 units from its U.S. website. Still, Cantor noted that Polestar s upcoming production facility in South Carolina could help offset some of the pressure.  This line is shared with Volvo and has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, of which Polestar s unit mix will comprise ~50,000 vehicles,” the note said. For Rivian, the impact stems more from its reliance on overseas suppliers.  We view Rivian as one of the most impacted by the auto parts tariffs since the company is not as vertically integrated and is sourcing several components from overseas,” Sheppard wrote. Rivian shares fell 4.3% in pre-market trading Monday. In contrast, Tesla and Lucid are seen as less vulnerable due to their domestic manufacturing footprints and localized supply chains.  Tesla has prioritized domestic sourcing and maintains a high degree of vertical integration,” Cantor said.  Thus, we see it as better positioned and less impacted relative to other OEMs.” Still, Tesla shares declined 5.4% on April 3 and slid another 10.4% on April 4. Lucid Motors, which assembles all vehicles in the U.S., also benefits from its domestic footprint.  The company has a high degree of vertical integration and currently manufactures all its vehicles in the U.S., so we also see less impact from tariffs,” Cantor said. Lucid s Saudi Arabia facility, which is being upgraded to full production, is intended to serve the Middle East and global markets—not the U.S.—and therefore does not expose the company to the new tariffs. Shares of Lucid are trading 5% lower at $2.17 during Monday s pre-market session. Also, Wedbush Securities recently cautioned that the move could trigger sweeping price hikes of up to $15,000 per vehicle and cause  chaos” across the global auto supply chain. Ferrari has already responded, stating it will increase prices on select models by up to 10% after April 1 to offset the impact.  Every automaker in the world will have to raise prices in some form selling into the U.S., and the supply chain logistics of this tariff announcement heard around the world is hard to even put our arms around at this moment,” Wedbush said. GM currently builds 52% of its vehicles sold in the US at domestic facilities, while 30% come from Canada and Mexico and 18% from other regions. Ford s US production stands at 77%, with 21% sourced from Canada and Mexico and 2% from elsewhere. Wedbush called the proposed tariff  a back breaker and Armageddon for the auto industry globally” and warned it  throws the supply chain into pure panic mode.” The firm estimates the policy would add $100 billion in annual costs to the sector — a burden that would  essentially get passed directly onto the consumer and clearly erode demand on Day 1 of tariffs.” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in late March that the 25% tariff could eliminate General Motors  global profit and reduce Ford Motor Co. s by about 75%. He forecasted a  $14 billion cost to General Motors (amounting to essentially all of its global profits) and a $6 billion cost to Ford (amounting to ~75% of global profits).”",true,Trustful news,0.519799530506134

This is one of the reasons why Russia is distorting diplomacy, why it is refusing to agree to an unconditional ceasefire—they want to preserve their ability to strike our cities and ports from the sea,” Zelensky said in his evening address. Zelensky emphasized that a ceasefire at sea isn t just about navigation or food exports, but also about preventing further escalation.  (Russian President) Putin does not want to end the war. He wants to preserve the means to escalate it at any moment with even greater force,” he warned. The Ukrainian president called for continued pressure on Moscow.  If there is a ceasefire, it must be unconditional—one that does not allow for the destruction of life,” Zelensky said.  Putin is refusing. We are awaiting a response from the United States—and we also expect a response from all in Europe and around the world who truly want peace.” Three weeks ago, Ukraine and the U.S. agreed to implement a full 30-day ceasefire.

The pest controller spends his days criss-crossing Britain s second-largest city to remove rats, cockroaches and other unwanted creatures from people s homes. Lately, Timms  phone has barely stopped ringing as some 17,000 metric tons of garbage have piled up on Birmingham s streets.  The smell is absolutely unbelievable,” Timms told CNN.  You ve got rotting food, you ve got maggots on the floor crawling out of the bags.” Birmingham s garbage collectors have been on strike over pay, so some of the city s 1.2 million residents have not had their waste collected for weeks. Mounds of garbage bags, some several feet high, dot the red-brick streets like pins on a corkboard. In the Balsall Heath neighborhood, wind whistles through the puncture marks in one rotting heap where the rats and mice have burrowed in.  That s a five-star restaurant for them and they ve got a hotel to go with it,” said Timms. Business is booming — so much so that Timms, who works alone, cannot handle the caseload and has passed some jobs to rival pest controllers. He said the number of calls from people finding rats in their homes has shot up around 50% since the garbage workers  strikes started. It s a Dickensian portrait of a city in the world s sixth-biggest economy — a city that once propelled Britain s wealth-creating industrial revolution yet, less than two years ago, declared itself essentially bankrupt. A row of overflowing trash cans outside people s homes in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham, UK in March 2025. Jacob King/PA Images/Getty Images  There s rubbish everywhere, rats everywhere … (they re) bigger than cats,” Abid, one passer-by in Balsall Heath, told CNN.  This is Britain. This is 2025. What s going on?” The answer: Nearly 400 garbage collectors are striking over the city government s decision to eliminate a particular role within their ranks. Unite, the union representing the workers, argues that the move blocks workers  pay progression and demotes some staff, resulting in an annual salary cut of up to £8,000 ($10,390) in the worst cases. Birmingham City Council disputes that figure and says it has offered alternative roles and retraining opportunities to affected workers. On its website, the council states that  no worker need lose any money” and that the staffing changes are crucial part of its attempt to  become financially sustainable” and modernize its waste collection service. The bitter dispute recently tipped into its fourth consecutive month and has escalated. At first the strikes were intermittent, but in early March they turned indefinite. Only some of the city s garbage collectors and agency staff are still working, and according to the council, fewer than half the usual number of garbage trucks are currently operational. Some parts of the city appeared to be much more affected than others when CNN visited last week. CNN On Monday, the city council declared that the buildup of waste and the public health risk it poses had created a  major incident” — an official mechanism that allowed officials to deploy extra garbage trucks around the city. The council said that protesters have blocked trucks leaving waste depots, resulting in fewer collections from households.  It is a dangerous job, it s a dirty job, it s an extremely physically demanding job … so people deserve to be properly rewarded for it,” Onay Kasab, national lead officer at Unite, told CNN. Shattered finances The BBC series  Peaky Blinders,” about a crime gang set in 1920s Birmingham, put the city on the global map when it premiered over a decade ago — spawning its own tourism industry and bringing the city some sorely needed cachet. But Birmingham is struggling. In late 2023, the Birmingham City Council, run by Britain s ruling Labour Party, filed a section 114 notice — the local government version of bankruptcy — which halted all spending excluding that on essential services such as education and waste collection. It went bust in large part because an equal pay dispute stretching back many years means it must pay out huge sums in compensation to former workers — most of them women who were paid less than men for similar work. But the council s mistakes have added to pressures beyond its control. Demand for its services has risen as Brummies — the name for the city s residents — live longer, while the costs of delivering those services have risen, too. It s a predicament shared by local governments across the country, with many teetering on a financial knife edge. A cat rummages through uncollected refuse bags and fly-tipped furniture in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham in March 2025. Jacob King/PA Images/Getty Images Britain s local authorities receive a big chunk of their funding in the form of grants from the central government. But the value of these grants has plummeted since 2010, when the former Conservative government embarked on a decade of austerity designed to shrink the country s debts following the financial crisis. In England, councils  funding per resident — including both grants and local taxes — is 18% below its level in 2010 on average, according to a report in June 2024 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Birmingham s misfortunes weigh heavy on Timms, the pest controller.  I am fuming (about) the way the city is looking,” he said of the recent garbage crisis.  It s affecting everybody s health.” Still, the onslaught of negative news bothers the lifelong Brummy because it obscures the full truth of his hometown.  Brummies, there seems to be like a solidarity (between us), and it s fantastic,” he said.  I love Birmingham to bits.”",true,Trustful news,0.52085363864898682

Ibtihal Aboussad, a software engineer in the company s AI division who is based in Canada, was fired on Monday over  just cause, wilful misconduct, disobedience or wilful neglect of duty,” according to one of the documents. Another Microsoft software engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, had said she would resign from the company on Friday, April 11. But Microsoft terminated her role on Monday, according to an internal message viewed by CNBC. The company wrote that it  has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today.” Both employees chose Microsoft s 50th anniversary event to publicly voice their criticism. What Microsoft had hoped would be a celebratory period has turned into a brutal few days for the company, which is being hit, along with the rest of the market, by President Donald Trump s widespread tariffs. It s a topic that CEO Satya Nadella and his two predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, were forced to uncomfortably confront on Friday in an interview with CNBC s Andrew Ross Sorkin.  As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good,” Ballmer said, about the tariffs. Meanwhile, the celebration itself captured headlines more for the protesters  shared message than for Microsoft s half-century of accomplishments. Microsoft didn t immediately provide a comment. The first interruption on Friday came from Aboussad, who stood up during Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman s speech.  Mustafa, shame on you,” Aboussad said as she walked towards the stage at the event in Redmond, Washington.  You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.” Aboussad also called Suleyman a  war profiteer.”  You have blood on your hands,” she said before being swiftly escorted out.  All of Microsoft has blood on its hands.” Shortly after the interruption, Aboussad sent an email, which was viewed by CNBC, to Suleyman and other Microsoft executives, including CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe and Brad Smith, the company s president.  I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice,” Aboussad wrote in the email.  This is especially true when I ve witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue.” Aboussad continued in the email,  I did not sign up to write code that violates human rights,” adding a link to a  No Azure for Apartheid” petition. Microsoft wrote in the internal message that Aboussad s email to executives served as  an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct.” The company also said that Abousssad could have raised concerns  confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.” The document went on to say that Microsoft  has concluded that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event.”  Immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response,” Microsoft wrote. At a separate Microsoft event with executives on Friday, Agrawal interrupted a speech from Nadella with a similar protest and sent an email to executives afterward.  You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary,” Agrawal wrote in the email, which was viewed by CNBC, on Friday.  Over the past 1.5 years, I ve grown more aware of Microsoft s growing role in the military-industrial complex.” Agrawal wrote that Microsoft is  complicit” as a  digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide,” adding that  by working for this company, we are all complicit.” A Microsoft spokesperson said Friday that the company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of business practices.  We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate,” the spokesperson said.",true,Trustful news,0.52085363864898682

In his nightly video address, Mr. Zelenskyy said Ukraine s top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, had presented a report  on the front line, our presence in the Kursk region and our presence in the Belgorod region.   We continue active operations in the enemy s border areas and this is absolutely justified. The war must return to where it came from.  Our main objective remains the same: to protect our land and our communities in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions from Russian occupiers.  He later referred to operations in the area by Ukraine s 225th Assault Regiment and congratulated the unit for its performance. Zelenskyy repeated Kyiv s long-held contention that despite Russia s recapture of areas of Kursk in recent weeks, the operation was successful in that it drew Russian forces away from the war s main front line in Ukraine s Donetsk region.  Due to the entire Kursk operation, we have managed to reduce pressure on other frontline sectors, particularly in Donetsk region,  he said. The president last month referred obliquely to  certain steps  undertaken by Ukraine s military in Russia  a little below the Kursk region , implicitly suggesting a presence in Belgorod region. Russian military bloggers had reported battles in Belgorod region between Russian and Ukrainian troops. On Sunday, Russia said its troops had seized the village of Basivka in Ukraine s northeastern Sumy region -- opposite Kursk -- and were battering Ukrainian forces in different settlements. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly suggested that Russian forces carve out a buffer zone along the border. A Ukrainian military spokesperson issued a new denial on Monday that Basivka was in Russian hands.",true,Trustful news,0.52171891927719116

For the first time, a component made in India — a clock buffer from Aura Semiconductor — was found in a Russian weapon,  HUR said in a Telegram post. The discovery came as HUR documented nearly 200 newly identified parts across six types of Russian weaponry. These include the CRP antenna from the Russian-modified Shahed drone, North Korea s KN-24 ballistic missile, the onboard computer in the X-47 Kinzhal missile, and several reconnaissance and attack drones — including the Supercam S350, Gerbera, and Zala. The Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drone, known as Geran-2 when produced in Russia, has been widely deployed by Moscow for loitering kamikaze missions targeting Ukrainian cities, energy infrastructure, and frontline positions. According to HUR, only two American chips remain in the latest CRP antenna design of the Geran-2, illustrating Russia s shift toward components from countries not enforcing sanctions. In previous drone variants, antennas labeled in Chinese featured 13 out of 15 components made by Chinese firms, including key signal-processing chips from the Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute. For years, Russia has served as India s top arms supplier. However, the imposition of international sanctions has forced India to diversify its defense procurement and deepen its ties with Western arms producers. While India has publicly urged a diplomatic resolution to Russia s war in Ukraine, it has also continued expanding trade with Moscow.

The military initially said it opened fire because the vehicles were  advancing suspiciously” on nearby troops without headlights or emergency signals. An Israeli military official, speaking late Saturday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said that account was  mistaken.” The footage shows the Red Crescent and Civil Defense teams driving slowly with their emergency vehicles  lights flashing, logos visible, as they pulled up to help an ambulance that had come under fire earlier. The teams do not appear to be acting unusually or in a threatening manner as three medics emerge and head toward the stricken ambulance. Their vehicles immediately come under a barrage of gunfire, which goes on for more than five minutes with brief pauses. The owner of the phone can be heard praying. This frame grab from a video released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, taken with a phone by one of the 15 Palestinians medics killed, shows Red Crescent emergency vehicles, their lights and sirens flashing and their logos clearly visible, seconds before they came under a barrage of gunfire from Israeli army soldiers in Tel al-Sultan, a district of the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, early Sunday, March 23, 2025.

This is the path I chose, mother, to help people,” he cries, his voice weak. Eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers and a U.N. staffer were killed in the shooting before dawn on March 23 by Israeli troops conducting operations in Tel al-Sultan, a district of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Troops then bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. U.N. and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later to dig out the bodies. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society s vice president, Marwan Jilani, said the phone with the footage was found in the pocket of one of its slain staffers. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations distributed the video to the U.N. Security Council. The Associated Press obtained the video from a U.N. diplomat on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public. One paramedic who survived, Munzer Abed, confirmed the veracity of the video to the AP. Two block-shaped concrete structures visible in the video are also seen in a U.N. video released Sunday showing the recovery of the bodies from the site — a sign they are in the same location. Asked about the video, the Israeli military said Saturday that the incident was  under thorough examination.” One medic remains missing The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, called for an independent investigation.  We don t trust any of the army investigations,” he told a briefing at the U.N. on Friday. One medic, Assaad al-Nassasra, is still missing, the Red Crescent says. Abed said he saw al-Nassasra being led away blindfolded by Israeli troops. Al-Khatib said the organization has asked the military where it is holding the staffer. Al-Khatib said the slain men had been  targeted at close range” and that a forensic autopsy report would be released soon.

(Palestinian Red Crescent Society via AP) Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Israel has accused Hamas of moving and hiding its fighters inside ambulances and emergency vehicles, as well as in hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, arguing that justifies strikes on them. Medical personnel largely deny the accusations. Israeli strikes have killed more than 150 emergency responders from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense, most of them while on duty, as well as over 1,000 health workers, according to the U.N. The Israeli military rarely investigates such incidents. Ambulances under a barrage of Israeli fire Ambulances started heading to Tel al-Sultan at around 3:50 a.m. on March 23, responding to reports of wounded, Jilani said. The first ambulance returned safely with at least one casualty, he said. But, he said, subsequent ambulances came under fire. His hands trembling, Abed told the AP on Saturday that as his ambulance entered the area, its siren lights were on.  All of a sudden, I am telling you, there was direct shooting at us,” so intense that the vehicle ground to a stop, he said. A 10-year veteran of the Red Crescent, Abed said he was sitting in the back seat and ducked to the floor. He said he could hear nothing from his two colleagues in the front seat — the only others in the vehicle. They appear to have been killed instantly. Israeli troops, some with night goggles, dragged Abed out of the ambulance and onto the ground, he said. They made him strip to his underwear, beat him all over his body with their rifle butts, then tied his hands behind his back, he said. They interrogated him, asking him about his paramedic training and how many people were in the ambulance with him, he said. One soldier pressed the muzzle of his automatic rifle into his neck. Another pressed his knife blade into Abed s palm, almost cutting it, until a third soldier pulled them away and warned Abed,  They re crazy.” Abed said he witnessed them opening fire on the next vehicles to arrive. Soldiers forced him onto his stomach and pressed a gun into his back, he said, and amid the shooting in the darkness, so he could only see two Civil Defense vehicles. Video shows medic s terror The phone video shows a rescue convoy of Red Crescent and Civil Defense vehicles that was sent out after contact was lost with the stricken ambulance. Taken from the dashboard of one vehicle, it shows several ambulances and a fire truck moving down a road through a barren area in the darkness. The emergency lights on their roofs are flashing the entire way. They arrive at an ambulance on the side of the road and stop next to it, their lights still flashing. No Israeli troops are visible.  Lord, let them be OK,” a man in the car says. Then he cries out,  They re tossed around on the ground!” — apparently referring to bodies. Three men in orange Civil Defense clothing can be seen getting out of the vehicles and walking toward the stopped ambulance. A shot rings out and one of the men appears to fall. Gunfire erupts. The man holding the phone appears to scramble out of the car and onto the ground, but the screen goes black, though the audio continues. The gunfire goes on for nearly five and a half minutes, with long, heavy barrages followed by silences punctuated by individual shots and shouts and screams. Throughout, the man with the phone says over and over,  There is no God but God and Muhammad is God s prophet” — the profession of faith that Muslims say when they fear they are about to die. Near the end of the six-minute, 40-second video, voices can be heard shouting in Hebrew.  The Jews are coming,” the man said, referring to Israeli soldiers, before the video cuts off. The Israeli military official asserted there was  no mistreatment,” and said he didn t know why the vehicles had been buried. He had no information about the medic who remained missing. Israel claims they found militants afterward The Israeli military says that after the shooting, troops determined they had killed a Hamas figure named Mohammed Amin Shobaki and eight other militants. However, none of the 15 slain medics has that name, and no other bodies are known to have been found at the site. The military has not said what happened to Shobaki s body or released the names of the other alleged militants. The Israeli military official said Israel was  working to bring evidence” that Hamas operatives were killed. Jonathan Whittall, interim head in Gaza of the U.N. humanitarian office OCHA, dismissed allegations that the slain medics were Hamas militants, saying staff had worked with the same medics previously in evacuating patients from hospitals and other tasks.  These are paramedic crews that I personally have met before,” he said.  They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on. They were ready to save lives.” ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip; Keath from Cairo.

The government  is to set June 3 as the date for South Korea s 21st presidential election”, prime minister Han Duck-soo said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting. Yoon was removed by the constitutional court for violating his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on 3 December and mobilising troops in an attempt to halt parliamentary proceedings. The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the position becomes vacant. South Korea has faced months of political turmoil since Yoon stunned the country by declaring martial law, triggering his impeachment by parliament and the impeachment of prime minister Han Duck-soo, who is also acting president. Han s impeachment was later overturned by the constitutional court and he will continue in the role of acting president until the election. The power vacuum at the top of South Korea s government has overshadowed Seoul s efforts to deal with the administration of US President Donald Trump at a time of spiralling US tariffs and slowing growth in Asia s fourth-largest economy. Lee Jae-myung, the populist leader of the opposition liberal Democratic party who had lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in 2022, is a clear front-runner but faces legal challenges of his own under multiple trials for charges including violating the election law and bribery. Yoon s conservative People Power party has a wide-open field of candidates, led by labour minister Kim Moon-soo, who announced his intention to run on Tuesday. According to a Gallup poll published on 4 April, 34% of respondents supported Lee as the next leader, 9% backed conservative Kim Moon-soo, 5% former ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon, 4% Daegu mayor Hong Joon-pyo, and 2% Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon.

Israeli combatants said they were ordered to destroy homes, factories and farmland roughly 1km (0.6 miles) inside the perimeter of Gaza to make a  buffer zone”, with one describing the area as looking like Hiroshima. The testimonies are some of the first accounts by Israeli soldiers to be published since the latest war started in October 2023 after Hamas s attack on Israel. They were collected by Breaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military s grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts. Titled  The Perimeter” and published on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants.  This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said. Soldiers were  given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added. The ultimate result, however, was the creation of  a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said.  Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.” It stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip s south-east corner next to Egypt. A sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter  was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”. This was the routine, they said:  Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they re supposed to work on. We didn t know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.” View image in fullscreen An Israeli attack on southern Gaza Strip as seen from behind the border fence inside southern Israel last week. Photograph: Jim Hollander/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock Some soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens. While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and  extermination”. The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants  accounts. One of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a  civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a  terrorist”. Rules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts. A sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given  shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter.  For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away , and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don t kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away  means a tank fire,” he said. View image in fullscreen Israeli troops and tanks deployed near an agricultural field next to the border with the Gaza Strip. Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images But a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a  kill zone”, saying:  The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.” Another captain said there were  no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a  generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added:  There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.  [We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn t matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.” How Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said.  How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don t go near it.” Before the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies. Satellite imagery has previously revealed the IDF destroyed hundreds of buildings that stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act that rights groups say may constitute collective punishment and should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel s defence minister said the military would seize  large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive. The perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip s entire agricultural land, according to the report. Despite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area  again and again after we fired at them”. View image in fullscreen An Israeli army vehicle moves near the border with the Gaza Strip, as seen last week from a position on the Israeli side in southern Israel.

People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.” Some got away with their food and their lives, the officer said.  The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public s wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza .” In an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the  need to pick up a gun”.  A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we re going to kill them,” they said.  And I found out that we re not only killing them – we re killing them, we re killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs.

Back in 2021, such cases were rare, but since 2022 - there have been tens of thousands across the country. The Barents Observer counted the number of verdicts issued by military courts in the northern regions of Russia. In Russian criminal law, military refusal to serve is divided into several categories. Unauthorized abandonment of a unit (Article 337 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) is when a serviceman leaves his place of service without permission, but without the clear intention to completely evade service. Desertion (Article 338) is a more serious crime: a conscious and final departure with the intent not to return. Sometimes the investigation starts the case as desertion, but courts often reclassify it as unauthorized absence — especially if the serviceman returns voluntarily. Faking illness (Article 339) is another way of evasion, where a serviceman tries to avoid service by pretending to have health problems. However, cases under this article are not initiated very often. The difference between the articles is primarily in the wording and maximum terms: desertion carries up to 15 years, unauthorised absence up to 10, and faking illness also up to 10 years. Soldiers on the march in the Pechenga region. Photo: Atle Staalesen Military towns in the Kola Peninsula The Murmansk Region is the only region in the north where six garrison military courts operate simultaneously. This is directly related to the region s dense military presence: the Northern Fleet is based here along with strategic submarines, air defence units and coastal troops. Almost every second settlement in the region is a garrison town. Severomorsk, Polyarny, Gadzhievo, Zaozyorsk, Pechenga, Alakurtti, Vidyayevo - all these towns exist around military service. It was here that mobilisation and participation in the war was felt first and foremost, and it was here that there was a sharp increase in criminal cases against those who decided to refuse to fight. The Murmansk Garrison Military Court issued 152 sentences in the course of the two first years of full-scale war, mainly under the article on unauthorised absence from the unit. Only three cases concerned desertion, although prosecutors often try to initiate cases with this more serious article. One of the few sentences of desertion, the text of which was made publicly available, is the case of Yevgeny Safonov, a contract soldier of the Northern Fleet. He twice left the unit without permission. In one of the episodes, he returned, but instead of starting service, he climbed over the fence and left, not answering calls from the command. The court regarded this as failure to report for duty during mobilisation. Initially, he was accused of desertion, but the court mitigated the article and sentenced Safarov to three years in a general prison colony. In the Gadzhiyevo Garrison Court, there have been 46 sentences since February 2022. For comparison: in 2021, there were only two such cases, in 2020 — one, in 2019 — two. An increase of more than twenty times. In Severomorsk, where the headquarters of the Northern Fleet is located, 22 sentences have been issued since the start of the full-scale invasion. Before the war, there were only a few cases per year. In Zaozersk, there are another 113. In 2021, there were eleven cases here, in 2020 — two. In Severomorsk, there is also another legal body — the Northern Fleet Military Court. It hears appeals against decisions of lower courts in the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions. Since October 2022, the court has issued 272 decisions on  military” articles.

Barents Observer spoke with one of the Russian  refuseniks  — the 29-year-old Dmitry Vasilets, a former serviceman of the Northern Fleet. He spent a year and three months in a settlement colony to avoid returning to the war in Ukraine. According to Vasilets, he refused to carry out combat orders on moral grounds after the death of two close friends. In the interview, he said that in his brigade, at least five or six officers followed the same path, preferring to admit guilt and serve real terms — albeit minimal — rather than being sent back to the front. The Arkhangelsk region In the Arkhangelsk region, cases of refusal to serve are distributed among three garrison courts — in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk, and Mirny. Each of them reflects its military landscape: from coastal units to missile units and strategic facilities. The Arkhangelsk garrison court recorded 114 sentences under  military  articles. It is the largest court in the region by the number of cases, considering cases of both contract soldiers and those mobilised from support and communication units. In Severodvinsk — a city where the Sevmash and Zvezdochka yards are located, building nuclear submarines for the Navy and carrying out their repairs — there is a separate garrison court. It has 94 sentences to its credit. Court decisions are not published, but the overall number shows that disciplinary and criminal pressure on those who do not want to serve remains high. In Mirny — a city near the Plesetsk Cosmodrome — the situation clearly illustrates how quickly the workload on the garrison court can change. In 2022, there were no sentences here. In 2021, 2020, and 2019 — one case per year. And since the beginning of 2023 — 59 sentences, almost all under the article on  absence without leave . Soldiers from Pechenga, Murmansk region.

After 2023, it started to publish decisions with the names of individuals involved. In total, there are 75 decisions on  military  articles. One of them is the case of V.V. Napalkov, convicted for two episodes of leaving his unit during the mobilisation period. He initially hid for three weeks, returned, then disappeared again for two months, living with friends and family. The court sentenced Napalkov to 6 years and 6 months of imprisonment. He claimed he had received verbal permission to be absent, but the court did not believe him. Republic of Karelia The Petrozavodsk Garrison Military Court — the only military court in Karelia — has issued 136 sentences on military articles over two years of war. For comparison, in 2021, there was only one such case, in 2020 — none, and in 2019 — three. That is, over the entire preceding five-year period, there were only four sentences, but after the invasion — an average of five per month. This court publishes decisions with open names, and some materials remain available on the official website. Among these is the sentence of V.R. Nummert, a contract soldier who did not return from leave in the autumn of 2022 and hid with relatives for over a year, working in various jobs. In court, he explained his behaviour as a fear of going to war and a desire to  rest a little.  The court did not accept these explanations and sentenced him to six years in a strict regime under Article 338 of the Russian Criminal Code. All of Russia If we add up all the mentioned decisions by garrison courts in northern Russia, there are more than 800 court decisions under Articles 337, 338, and 339 of the Criminal Code, starting from the spring of 2022. This is a minimum, as many courts do not publish decisions or hide them under general terms. The northern regions, especially those with military bases, are now areas where military personnel flee, hide, and fake illness. And military courts are increasing the flow of sentences. Deserters in north Russian regions. Graphics by the Barents Observer The north is not the only region in Russia where mass refusals to participate in the war are recorded. According to an internal presentation for Russian officials, published by the Ukrainian community InformNapalm and analysed by Frontelligence Insight, the total number of documented cases of refusal to serve, including unauthorised absence, in 2024 amounted to 50,554. Most criminal cases were initiated in the Southern Military District — almost 12,000, of which 58% were mobilised from the so-called  LDNR,  report newspaper Important Stories. BBC reported that in Ukraine, since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than 95,000 cases of desertion and unauthorised absence from duty have been opened. This is about 10% of the Ukrainian army. The human rights project  Go to the Forest” helps Russians who refuse to fight.

Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia were responsible for the majority of deaths, the report found. The Middle Eastern trio collectively killed 1,380 people, with Iran being responsible for the majority (972).  The death penalty is an abhorrent practice with no place in today s world. While secrecy continued to shroud scrutiny in some countries that we believe are responsible for thousands of executions, it s evident that states that retain the death penalty are an isolated minority. With just 15 countries carrying out executions in 2024, the lowest number on record for the second consecutive year, this signals a move away from this cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International s Secretary General.  Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia were responsible for the sharp spike in deaths last year, carrying out over 91% of known executions, violating human rights and callously taking people s lives for drug-related and terrorism charges.” Yemen was also among the top five countries responsible for executions.  Those who dare challenge authorities have faced the most cruel of punishments, particularly in Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the death penalty used to silence those brave enough to speak out,” said Callamard.  In 2024, Iran persisted in their use of the death penalty to punish individuals who had challenged the Islamic Republic establishment during the Woman Life Freedom uprising. Last year saw two of those people – including a youth with a mental disability – executed in connection with the uprising following unfair trials and torture-tainted ‘confessions , proving how far the authorities are willing to go to tighten their grip on power.” The first mural, featuring Mahsa Amini and other martyrs, was a bold declaration of solidarity with the women of Iran. (credit: Courtesy, Hooman Khalili) Investigators found that a total of 1518 people were killed in 2024, although the NGO acknowledged that thousands more were likely executed in countries like China, North Korea, Syria, and Vietnam. Despite the large number of deaths, Amnesty International found that fewer countries than ever before were using the death sentence - with 113 countries now fully abolitionist and 145 having entirely abolished the death penalty in law or practice.  When people prioritize campaigning for an end to the death penalty, it really does work,” asserted Callamard.  Despite the minority of leaders determined to weaponize the death penalty, the tide is turning. It s only a matter of time until the world is free from the shadows of the gallows.” Crimes and sentencing Over 40% of 2024 s executions were carried out unlawfully for drug-related offenses, according to the report. Drug-related executions were prevalent in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and, while no confirmation was possible, likely Viet Nam. In many contexts, sentencing people to death for drug-related offences has been found to impact those from disadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately. At the same time, it has no proven effect in reducing drug trafficking,” highlighted Callamard.  Leaders who promote the death penalty for drug-related offenses are proposing ineffective and unlawful solutions. States considering introducing capital punishment for drug-related offences, such as the Maldives, Nigeria and Tonga, must be called out and encouraged to put human rights at the centre of their drug policies.” Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now In addition to drug offenses, the report found that the death sentence has been selectively applied to silence critics of the state or political dissidents - although it highlighted that official documents may not overtly reflect this. Amnesty International cited the case of Abdulmajeed al-Nimr, who was executed for terrorism-related offences in Saudi Arabia for allegedly attempting to join Al-Qaeda - despite initial court documents referring to his participation in anti-government protests.",true,Trustful news,0.5246880054473877

The cabinet agreed on the date on Tuesday (April 8, 2025) after discussions with the National Election Commission since it needed to approve a public holiday for the election. Mr. Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court for violating his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops in an attempt to halt parliamentary proceedings. The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the position becomes vacant. South Korea has faced months of political turmoil since Mr. Yoon stunned the country by declaring martial law, triggering his impeachment by parliament and the impeachment of acting leader Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Mr. Han s impeachment was later overturned by the Constitutional Court and he will continue in the role of acting president until the election. The power vacuum at the top of South Korea s government has overshadowed Seoul s efforts to deal with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of spiralling U.S. tariffs and slowing growth in Asia s fourth-largest economy. Lee Jae-myung, the populist leader of the liberal Democratic Party who lost to Mr. Yoon by a razor-thin margin in 2022, is a clear front-runner but faces legal challenges of his own under multiple trials for charges including violating the election law and bribery. The conservatives have a wide-open field of candidates. According to a Gallup poll published on April 4, 34% of respondents supported Lee as the next leader, 9% backed conservative Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo, 5% former ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon, 4% Daegu mayor Hong Joon-pyo, and 2% Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon.",true,Trustful news,0.52520215511322021

Poland strongly condemns further Russian attacks on Ukraine. Russia must be held accountable for the deaths of Ukrainian citizens and the destruction of civilian infrastructure,  the ministry posted on X.  Moscow s recent actions show that its goal is further war, not peace,  it added. The statement follows Russia s missile strike on Kryvyi Rih on April 4, which killed 20 people, including nine children, in President Volodymyr Zelensky s hometown. On Sunday morning, a Russian ballistic missile attack on Kyiv killed one person and injured three others. The attacks came weeks after Ukraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire in U.S.-mediated talks in Jeddah on March 11. Russia rejected the deal unless it included restrictions on Ukraine s military, including the end of foreign military aid. Instead, a limited ceasefire was reached covering energy infrastructure and the Black Sea. Two days later, Ukraine accused Russia of violating the deal by attacking Kherson s energy facilities. Moscow denied responsibility, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Russia  reserves the right  to abandon the agreement if Ukraine fails to comply. Russia also accused Ukraine of striking the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast, a claim Kyiv dismissed as an attempt to justify further attacks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 1 that Moscow submitted evidence of Ukrainian ceasefire violations to the U.S., the U.N., and OSCE. Zelensky also ordered Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to provide the U.S. with proof of Russian violations. Washington has not commented publicly on either side s accusations. U.S. President Donald Trump, who mediated the talks, is reportedly frustrated with the ongoing attacks. NBC News reported on March 30 that Trump is  pissed off  at Russian President Vladimir Putin s fixation on Zelensky, while the Telegraph wrote on March 23 that he is growing angry over Russia s refusal to de-escalate. On April 6, he reiterated his call for a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, urging Putin to stop the violence.  We are talking to Russia. We would like them to stop,  Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One.  I don t like the bombing, the bombing goes on and on, and every week thousands of young people being killed.

Let s take Vietnam. When they come to us and say  we ll go to zero tariffs,  that means nothing to us because it s the non-tariff cheating that matters,  Navarro said on CNBC s  Squawk Box.  The examples of non-tariff  cheating  cited by Navarro included Chinese products routed through Vietnam, intellectual property theft and a value added tax. The comments from Navarro come after President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the Monday interview, Navarro revised his statement to say that the offer of zero tariffs would be a  small first start.  A value added tax is a system used by many countries around the world and is in some ways similar to sales taxes in the U.S. The Trump administration s argument that the tax should count as a trade barrier is not widely accepted.  We have tried at the World Trade Organization since the 1970s to get VAT-tax relief, and they ve told us no every single time,  Navarro said Monday. This is breaking news.

Berneke acknowledged that Eutelsat — a French satellite operator providing limited service to Ukraine through a German government-funded distributor — cannot yet match Starlink s scale.  If we were to take over the entire connectivity capacity for Ukraine and all the citizens, — we wouldn t be able to do that. Let s just be very honest,  she said. While Eutelsat s OneWeb network has begun supporting Ukrainian government operations with fewer than 1,000 active terminals, the company aims to scale up to 5,000–10,000 units. This remains far behind the estimated 50,000 Starlink terminals active across Ukraine, serving military, medical, and civilian sectors. Berneke also raised concerns over the geopolitical risks of relying on a single private provider.  Working with Starlink is a dependence that can be decided in the White House or Mar-a-Lago,  she said, referencing U.S. President Donald Trump s residence. Those concerns have grown amid reports that Washington may use Starlink access as leverage. In February, Reuters reported the U.S. had threatened to cut the service unless Ukraine signed a critical minerals deal. Tech billionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk denied these claims, and on March 9, he claimed that cutting Ukraine off from Starlink would cause the country s entire front line to collapse. Uncertainty deepened following a Feb. 28 meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky, which led to a temporary halt in U.S. aid and intelligence sharing while the White House pushed Kyiv toward negotiations with Moscow.

Enhancing combat readiness and elevating joint mission effectiveness  would be central to the Cope Thunder exercise, Philippine Air Force commander Arthur Cordura said Monday at a ceremony to launch the drills. Military ties between the Philippines and United States have deepened since the 2022 election of President Ferdinand Marcos, with Manila pushing back on sweeping Chinese claims in the South China Sea that an international tribunal has ruled are without merit. The US State Department last week approved a long-mooted sale of F-16 fighter jets to the Philippines, though Manila said the deal was  still in the negotiation phase .

One man said he was attacked with chemicals and set alight.  I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out [on my body],  said Mohammad Abu Tawileh, a 36-year-old mechanic. We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held under Israel s Unlawful Combatants Law, external, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group. The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks - a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal. Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees. We also asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) if there were any convictions or accusations against the men but they did not respond to that question. In the men s testimony: They each describe being stripped, blindfolded, cuffed and beaten Some also say they were given electric shocks, menaced by dogs, and denied access to medical care Some say they witnessed the deaths of other detainees One says he witnessed sexual abuse Another says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire We have seen reports by a lawyer who visited two of the men in prison, and have spoken to medical staff who treated some of them on their return. The BBC sent a lengthy right of reply letter to the IDF which laid out in detail the men s allegations and their identities. In its statement, the IDF did not respond to any of the specific allegations, but said it  completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees . It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be  examined by the relevant authorities . It added that others  were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine . It continued:  The IDF takes any… actions which contradict its values very seriously… Specific complaints about inappropriate behaviour by detention facility staff or insufficient conditions are forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities and are dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.  The IPS said it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse described in our investigation, in its prisons.  [A]s far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,  it added. Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said the treatment the men described was  entirely inconsistent with both international law and Israeli law , and in some cases would  meet the threshold of torture .

This warning comes as the world watches Iran s growing nuclear activities, while key sanctions under the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) are set to end in October 2025. France s message is clear—without urgent talks and compromise, the world may be heading toward another war in the Middle East. What Is the JCPOA and Why It Matters The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 between Iran and major powers, including the U.S., to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. In return, many international sanctions on Iran were lifted. However, in 2018, the U.S. left the deal under President Donald Trump, and since then, Iran has slowly stopped following the agreement. It has increased its uranium enrichment to levels close to what is needed for a nuclear bomb. A February 2025 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed this worrying trend. Key parts of the JCPOA, including U.N. sanctions, are due to expire in October 2025. European countries are racing against time to stop Iran from crossing the nuclear line. Where the Main Countries Stand France and Europe France, along with Germany and the UK (known as the E3), wants to avoid war. They are pushing hard to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and hope to sign a new deal by August 2025. France believes that if talks fail, the U.S. or Israel might strike Iran s nuclear sites, leading to a wider war in the Middle East. United States Under President Trump, the U.S. has taken a tough stance called  maximum pressure.” This includes heavy economic sanctions and threats of military strikes. Trump has warned that if Iran does not agree to a deal, the U.S. may bomb its nuclear facilities. He also warned countries like China that buying oil from Iran could bring penalties. However, the U.S. has said it is still open to making a deal—if Iran is willing. Iran Iran refuses to talk directly to the U.S. but is open to indirect talks through countries like Oman. President Masoud Pezeshkian said on March 30, 2025, that Iran prefers indirect talks. However, Iran s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, is doubtful about making any deal with the U.S. Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful, but its actions—like speeding up uranium enrichment—raise global concerns. Israel Israel sees Iran s nuclear activities as a major threat. It has already conducted joint air drills with the U.S. and may be preparing for a military strike. Israel believes Iran is not just a threat because of its nuclear program, but also because of the support it gives to groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, who have launched attacks on Israel. What Experts and the Public Are Saying There is no agreement among experts or the public. Some think that only military action will stop Iran, while others warn that war would bring global economic problems and make the Middle East even more unstable. A report by the Arms Control Association in March 2025 said that if there is no deal by summer, Europe may bring back U.N. sanctions, which could make the situation worse. On social media, users are also divided. Some worry that any military strike could lead to a full war, while others believe that force is the only way to stop Iran. What Could Happen Next Time is running out. France s warning shows how serious the situation has become. The October 2025 deadline is key—after that, Iran could legally expand its nuclear program without limits if no new agreement is signed. Here s a quick look at where the key players stand: Country/Group What They Want What They Are Doing France & Europe A peaceful deal to avoid war Pushing for talks before August United States Stop Iran s nuclear program Using sanctions, military threats Iran Keep enriching uranium, no direct talks Open to indirect talks, speeding up nuclear work Israel Stop Iran, even by force Preparing for possible military strike Experts & Public Mixed views Some support diplomacy, others support strikes Conclusion France s warning shows that the world is at a dangerous turning point. If a new nuclear deal is not made soon, the chance of war will grow. With the U.S. taking a hard line, Iran refusing direct talks, and Israel ready to act, the risk of conflict is rising.",true,Trustful news,0.52925205230712891

The rebound erased some of the steep losses suffered on Monday when the share market recorded its worst session in five years, down by more than 4%.

In response, China s commerce ministry has vowed to fight US tariffs  to the end”. Fund managers have told Guardian Australia they are looking for signs of a truce in the tariff tit-for-tat to signal that a sustained recovery in equities may be on the cards. Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, said on Tuesday that Trump s fresh tariff threat against China was a risk for traders and  should heighten the wall that the market needs to climb”. While the details of Trump s  liberation day” initially spooked investors, the retaliatory tariffs from major trading nations and blocs like China and the EU triggered market panic. Traders have been weighing up whether Trump is using the threat of tariffs to cut deals or whether they will be locked into place this week, reordering global trade. There is growing concern that if the latter occurs, a  full-blown trade war, imminent recession and a liquidity crunch last seen during the early pandemic” may ensue, according to IG analysts. Meanwhile, the Australian share market is being pulled and pushed by international forces, and was led higher on Tuesday by the US futures market. Australia s benchmark closed at 7,510 points on Tuesday, up 2.3%, marking a shift in sentiment that saw share prices collapse the day before. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update: Election 2025 Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A weaker currency is generally bad for Australian travellers and consumers buying overseas goods, but positive for exporters. The Australian dollar has close links to commodity prices, particularly iron ore, which would suffer if global economic activity slowed, especially in China. While the market ruptures have caught many traders by surprise, State Street Global Advisors data shows that long-term institutional investors had reduced their exposure to shares last month ahead of the  liberation day” tariff announcement.  Investor caution prompted a further retracement out of equities and into bonds and cash in approximately equal increments,” the State Street economist and market strategist Dwyfor Evans said on Tuesday. Investors typically limit risk in their portfolios by allocating more of their portfolio to cash and fixed income, while reducing exposure to more volatile assets like equities.",true,Trustful news,0.533264696598053
1jthcqj,2025-04-07 09:42:10,EU has no clear plan for Ukrainian refugees in the event of ceasefire,https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/7/7506356/,Andrew_Secret,Reddit,EU has no clear plan for Ukrainian refugees in the event of ceasefire,"Millions of Ukrainian refugees in the EU may be at risk of losing their legal status, as there is no clear plan to allow them to stay after a ceasefire with Russia. Source: European Pravda with reference to an article by Euractiv Details: Since Russia s invasion in February 2022, the EU Temporary Protection Directive has become a legal lifeline for almost 4.3 million Ukrainians. Advertisement: It allows EU countries to grant the right to live, work and access services to Ukrainians, most of whom have settled in Poland, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia. However, as the ceasefire talks continue, this safety net could be disrupted. A ceasefire may change the scenario overnight, and host countries will be forced to decide whether to roll back protection, insist on integration or push refugees to return home. Advertisement: Last year, EU governments agreed to extend temporary protection until March 2026, going far beyond the original scope of a two-year protection period with a possible one-year extension. Any extension will be granted on a year-to-year basis. The levels of protection also vary from country to country. Each EU country interprets the directive somewhat differently in its national legislation, which means that Ukrainians are treated differently depending on where they settle. The European Commission said it has begun considering the next steps, including whether or not to extend temporary protection, help people transition to national status for work, study or family reunification, and support those who decide to return to Ukraine. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakušan confirmed that Czechia, along with Germany and the European Commission, is actively involved in formulating a joint response during the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU.  But the specific conditions are yet to be negotiated,  Rakušan said. As Euractiv has learned, the EU Council is due to consider the issue at its next meeting of interior ministers in June. Czech Interior Ministry spokeswoman Hana Malá confirmed that any decision to end temporary protection will require the agreement of all EU member states. She added that they expect a common EU position to be reached in the first half of this year. Some countries are not waiting for Brussels and are taking steps to find a  more long-term regular status . Poland will soon offer a three-year national temporary residence status to Ukrainians who have had continuous temporary protection for at least a year. In Czechia, a new special five-year residence permit will be available for Ukrainians who have lived there for more than two years and have a job, with compulsory school attendance for their children. But even Czechia, one of the largest host countries, has made it clear that it will not issue any new temporary residence permits  once the war is over , as the interior minister has said. Other capitals are developing their own plans. Austria, Italy, Estonia and Latvia are adopting long-term solutions with varying levels of protection. Germany s Interior Ministry said it has already developed options, but it is up to the next government to decide what proposals will be put forward on the issue, stressing the need for a coordinated European approach. Background: The Romanian government recently extended humanitarian support and assistance for vulnerable individuals who have fled the armed conflict zone in Ukraine until 31 December 2025. It has also been reported that the authorities in Amsterdam have been forced to turn away Ukrainian refugees in recent weeks due to a lack of available accommodation in the city. Additionally, it was recently announced that starting from 1 May, Ukrainian military refugees who are not registered residents of the Estonian capital, Tallinn, will no longer have the right to free public transport in the city.
