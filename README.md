## Reddit Fake News Detection Project

### ü§ñ Goal

Welcome to the **Reddit Fake News Detector** ‚Äì a data-driven system designed to classify news headlines from Reddit's r/worldnews as *real* or *fake* using natural language processing and machine learning.
For this project, we had 2 weeks to build a **proof of concept**. The goal was to create a **pipeline** that could be used to scrape, store, and analyze news headlines from the worldNews Reddit and check their veracity.
The project is built using **Python** and various libraries such as **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**. The machine learning model is based on the **BERT** architecture, which is fine-tuned for the task of fake news detection.
